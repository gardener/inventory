  # This section provides configuration specific to each GCP service and which
  # named credentials to be used when creating API clients for the respective
  # service. Inventory supports specifying multiple named credentials per
  # service, which means that collection will happen against each configured
  # named credential.
  #
  # For instance, if `compute' service specifies named credentials `foo' and
  # `bar', then Inventory will connect and collect Compute Resources from the
  # specified projects for the configured named credentials.

    # Resource Manager API clients collect only GCP Project resources.

  # The `credentials' section provides named credentials, which are used by the
  # various GCP services. The currently supported authentication mechanisms are

  #
  # When using `none' as the authentication mechanism the API client will be initialized
  # using `Application Default Credentials' strategy [1].

  # When using `key_file' the API client will be configured to authenticate
  # using the specified service account credentials file [2].
