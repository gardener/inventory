# inventory

The Gardener Inventory is a system, which collects resources from various data
sources, persists the data, and establishes relationships between the resources.

The collected data can be later analyzed to show the relationship and
dependencies between the various resources.

# Requirements

- Go 1.22.x or later
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

[Valkey](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey) or [Redict](https://redict.io),
can be used instead of Redis.
